# MemeMe
iOS Application that allows users to create and share memes.

## About the App:

MemeMe is an iOS app that allows users to create memes on their phone and both save them to the phone or share them with their friends. MemeMe gives users the opportunity to take a new photo with their camera or use one of the existing photos in their photo library to make a meme. Text can be added to both the top and bottom of the photo to create the meme. 

- The color of the text can easily be changed to make better more interesting memes.

## Requirements to Use the App:

- MemeMe is currently written in Swift 2.2 and compatible with iOS 7-9. 

## Other Things to Know:

- In order to save a Meme, users need to tap the activity indicator even if they do not intend to share the app. 

- As of now, meme text cannot be moved to fit within the picture. Some pictures need to be taken horizontally in order for text to be displayed within the image.
